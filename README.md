I have chosen to create a chrome extension that helps you parse research papers and find other papers that the authors have authored in order of relevance. This is related to ranking relevance of different data. The datasets that I will be using will be coming through API keys from `dev.elsevier.com`. We will query for data that the author has published and rank based on paper relevance. I plan on using native javascript to parse the data, and will demonstrate that it works by finding individuals with papers published in different fields. If the relevance is valid, then fields differing from the current paper will not be selected. This will likely take more than 20 hours for the follwing reasons:
 - Parse PDFs through JS (3 hours)
 - Hook up API properly (2 hours)
 - Find relevant information and using the valid algiorithms (10 hours)
 - Testing different tradeoffs (2 hours)
 - Debugging/Optimizations (5 hours)
